                                                Hospital</span> with a specific focus on optimizing the layout and organization to enhance the efficiency of 
                                                <span class="highlight-word">thoracotomy procedures</span>. We were tasked with creating <span class="highlight-word">short-term and

                                            <p>
                                                With Children’s Hospital undergoing renovations, the hospital staff recognized that this would be a good opportunity 
                                                to address some of the inefficiencies they have in their trauma wing. Specifically, they identified the thoracotomy 
                                                procedure as an area that needs to improve. Our team started the project by doing <span class="highlight-word">research</span> 
                                                about the procedure itself as well as the <span class="highlight-word">roles and responsibilities</span> of the different 
                                                staff members that conduct the procedure. 
                                            </p>
                                        </div>

                                            <p>
                                                The next step was to go through several stages of <span class="highlight-word">user interviews</span>, talking to staff member 
                                                of various roles to identify pain points and <span class="highlight-word">opportunities for improvement</span> in the current layout 
                                                and organization of the trauma room. Some of the problems we found were that the equipment for the procedure were not always easily 
                                                identifiable, the storage for the equipment could be more easily accessible, and there is not always enough space to move around the 
                                                trauma room due to the amount of people working and observing.

                                                Between each round of interviews, we <span class="highlight-word">brainstormed</span> short-term and long-term solutions for optimizing 
                                                the trauma room layout, including <span class="highlight-word">innovative floor plans</span> tailored to the specific needs of 
                                                thoracotomy procedures. The short-term improvements were constrained to the size and location of the trauma room that was currently in 
                                                use while the long-term improvements had much more freedom for the entire design of the room.
