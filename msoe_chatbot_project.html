                    <b>I collaborated on a project to develop an AI chatbot prototype tailored for Milwaukee School of 
                        Engineering (MSOE). The aim was to address the specific need of facilitating student access to 
                        the university’s health and support services. This project spanned over a semester in a group with 
                        one other person. My role as the team lead involved:

                    its functionality. To achieve this, we made the choice to focus on the specific use case of helping students 
                    connect to MSOE’s health and support services. These services include health care from a nurse practitioner, 
                    mental health counseling, and academic support services. Utilizing skills in user research, persona
