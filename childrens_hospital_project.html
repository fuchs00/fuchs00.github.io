                        As part of a class design project, we were tasked with redesigning the trauma room at Children's Hospital 
                        with a specific focus on optimizing the layout and organization to enhance the efficiency of thoracotomy 
                        procedures. We were tasked with creating short-term and long-term solutions for optimizing the trauma room 
                        layout that ensures a seamless workflow with accessibility to essential equipment. The project spanned 
                        several months, and I worked closely with a multidisciplinary team responsible for:

                    <p>
                        With Children’s Hospital undergoing renovations, the hospital staff recognized that this would be a good 
                        opportunity to address some of the inefficiencies they have in their trauma wing. Specifically, they 
                        identified the thoracotomy procedure as an area that needs to improve. Our team started the project by 
                        doing research about the procedure itself as well as the roles and responsibilities of the different staff 
                        members that conduct the procedure.

                <div class="text-par">
                    <p>
                        The next step was to go through several stages of user interviews, talking to staff member of various 
                        roles to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement in the current layout and organization 
                        of the trauma room. Some of the problems we found were that the equipment for the procedure were not always 
                        easily identifiable, the storage for the equipment could be more easily accessible, and there is not always 
                        enough space to move around the trauma room due to the amount of people working and observing.

                <div class="text-par">
                    <p>
                        Between each round of interviews, we brainstormed short-term and long-term solutions for optimizing the trauma 
                        room layout, including innovative floor plans tailored to the specific needs of thoracotomy procedures. The 
                        short-term improvements were constrained to the size and location of the trauma room that was currently in use 
                        while the long-term improvements had much more freedom for the entire design of the room.

                        We created visualizations of our proposed redesigns to effectively communicate our concepts to stakeholders from 
                        Children’s Hospital. Our short-term solution revised the organization of essential equipment to maximize the 
                        space of the current trauma room. The proposed room for our long-term solution includes similar organization 
                        for essential equipment and is almost twice the size of the current trauma room, allowing for a more comfortable amount 
                        of space for those performing the procedure as well as observing.

                        Our proposed redesigns were presented to a team of representatives from Children’s Hospital, highlighting how 
                        these changes can improve the pain points from thoracotomy procedures that they experience. This direct 
                        collaboration with stakeholders helped bring forward a deeper understanding of how our ideas can impact people 
                        in an area as influential as a trauma room.
