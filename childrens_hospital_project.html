                                    <p>
                                        As part of a class design project, we were tasked with redesigning the trauma room at Children's Hospital with a 
                                        specific focus on optimizing the layout and organization to enhance the efficiency of thoracotomy procedures. We 
                                        were tasked with creating short-term and long-term solutions for optimizing the trauma room layout that ensures a 
                                        seamless workflow with accessibility to essential equipment. The project spanned several months, and I worked 
                                        closely with a multidisciplinary team responsible for:
                                    </p>

                                    <h2>Gathering Information</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        With Children’s Hospital undergoing renovations, the hospital staff recognized that this would be a good opportunity 
                                        to address some of the inefficiencies they have in their trauma wing. Specifically, they identified the thoracotomy 
                                        procedure as an area that needs to improve. Our team started the project by doing research about the procedure itself 
                                        as well as the roles and responsibilities of the different staff members that conduct the procedure. 
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="text-par">
                                    <p>
                                        The next step was to go through several stages of user interviews, talking to staff member of various roles to identify 
                                        pain points and opportunities for improvement in the current layout and organization of the trauma room. Some of the 
                                        problems we found were that the equipment for the procedure were not always easily identifiable, the storage for the 
                                        equipment could be more easily accessible, and there is not always enough space to move around the trauma room due to 
                                        the amount of people working and observing. 
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    <h2>Creating Solutions</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Between each round of interviews, we brainstormed short-term and long-term solutions for optimizing the trauma room layout, 
                                        including innovative floor plans tailored to the specific needs of thoracotomy procedures. The short-term improvements 
                                        were constrained to the size and location of the trauma room that was currently in use while the long-term improvements had 
                                        much more freedom for the entire design of the room.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                        We created visualizations of our proposed redesigns to effectively communicate our concepts to stakeholders from Children’s 
                                        Hospital. Our short-term solution revised the organization of essential equipment to maximize the space of the current trauma 
                                        room. The proposed room for our long-term solution includes similar organization for essential equipment and is almost twice 
                                        the size of the current trauma room, allowing for a more comfortable amount of space for those performing the procedure as 
                                        well as observing.

                                        Our proposed redesigns were presented to a team of representatives from Children’s Hospital, highlighting how these changes can 
                                        improve the pain points from thoracotomy procedures that they experience. This direct collaboration with stakeholders helped 
                                        bring forward a deeper understanding of how our ideas can impact people in an area as influential as a trauma room.
