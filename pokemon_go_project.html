                                        As part of our Design Systems class capstone project, our entire class undertook the challenge of enhancing the user 
                                        experience of the Pokémon GO mobile game. This project required us to leverage our skills in communication design, 
                                        information architecture, visual design, and interface design to develop a cohesive design system for the game. The 
                                        project duration spanned an entire semester, and I worked as a part of the Design Team responsible for:

                                            Determining common aesthetic designs and patterns for the design system

                                            Designing a feature that improved user connectivity and gameplay dynamics

                                    </ul>
                                </div>

                                        Early research involved playing a lot of Pokémon GO as well as conducting some user research, interviewing people 
                                        who are both familiar and unfamiliar with the game. This is where we discovered that some common goals among users 
                                        involved spending time with their friends and battling with their Pokémon. 
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="text-par">
                                    <p>
                                        Creating user personas and journey maps provided the team members a shared understanding for the users’ experience 
                                        and expectations from the game. This helped us define where the users’ sources of enjoyment and problems existed. 
                                        An information architecture framework was also developed to organize game’s content and features in a logical and 
                                        intuitive way.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="text-par">
                                    <p>
                                        As the Design Team, we established a cohesive visual language and design patterns for the game’s interface elements. 
                                        We used these elements as the building blocks for the new features we wanted to add to the game. Our proposed features 
                                        were a new Pokémon battle mechanic in the form of a “Battle Tower” and a friend-finding feature where you can locate 
                                        your friends on the game’s map.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="text-par">
                                    <p>
                                        I was responsible for designing and prototyping the friend-finding feature. The goal of this feature was to improve 
                                        user connectivity and increase social interactions within Pokémon GO. Using Adobe XD, I created an interactive 
                                        prototype that added a new menu that simulated how the user would access and interact with the new feature. The 
                                        prototype was also refined and optimized based on user feedback.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="text-par">
                                    <p>
                                        The results of the proposed features and visual design library were put together in a comprehensive presentation and 
                                        demonstration, showcasing the project’s process, outcomes, and the rationale behind design decisions. Our contributions 
                                        to the cohesive design system provided a unified visual identity and consistent user experience across different 
                                        aspects of the game.
