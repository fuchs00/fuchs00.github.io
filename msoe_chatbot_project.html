                                    <p>
                                        For a Conversation Design class, I collaborated on a project to develop an AI chatbot prototype tailored 
                                        for Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE). We were tasked with designing a chatbot with a specific use case 
                                        to help students. Our aim was to help students access MSOE’s health and support services. Over the 
                                        course of a semester, I was the team lead responsible for:
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    <h2>Defining Needs & Problems</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Our early user research revealed to us that it is not uncommon for students to either be uncomfortable with or 
                                        unsure how to reach out to the university’s physical and mental health support services. An AI chatbot seemed 
                                        like the perfect canvas for providing a tool where students can ask questions in a way that is as stress and 
                                        anxiety free as possible. 
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <img src="images/assets/Header Paint Divider.png" class="header-paint">
                                <div class="text-par">
                                    <h2>Crafting User Interaction</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        From here we determined exactly what support services MSOE offered. Our chatbot focused on connecting students 
                                        to the University’s Wellness Center and Raider Center for Academic Succes (RCAS). The Wellness Center specializes 
                                        in helping students improve their physical and mental health while RCAS helps student with their academic health. 
                                        We did not want to be liable for providing any suggestions to improve a student’s health as that type of advice 
                                        should only come from one of MSOE’s many support professionals.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    <p>
                                        The personality of our chatbot had to be friendly, empathetic, and informational. We wanted a name and avatar for 
                                        the chatbot that reflected these traits and hopefully comforted students as they asked it questions. The chatbot 
                                        was named WISE, an acronym for Wellness, Information, Support, and Education, and was given an avatar of a cute 
                                        and welcoming owl.

                                    <p>
                                        The conversation design of WISE was a long process with several iterations of conversation flows. Starting in Figma 
                                        we outlined WISE’s prompts and how users would interact with it. Eventually we moved this conversation flow into Voiceflow, 
                                        an AI chatbot prototyping tool. Each iteration was refined with information gathered by feedback from user testing and 
                                        interviews with a representative from MSOE’s marketing department.

                                    <p>
                                        In a comprehensive presentation showcasing WISE’s capabilities and potential impact on improving the health of students, 
                                        the final prototype was demonstrated to the class and MSOE’s marketing department. Receiving positive feedback, the chatbot 
                                        effectively highlighted how connecting students to the health and support services at MSOE can improve their overall 
                                        experience and engagement.
