                        As part of a design project, we were tasked with redesigning the trauma room at Children's Hospital with a specific 
                        focus on optimizing the layout and organization to enhance the efficiency of thoracotomy procedures. This project required 
                        gaining insights into the challenges and requirements from hospital staff and collaborating with stakeholders to devise 
                        innovative solutions. The project duration spanned several months, and I worked closely with a multidisciplinary team to 
                        address the complex needs of the trauma room.

                        Our primary tasks involved conducting user interviews with hospital staff to understand their challenges and requirements, 
                        devising short-term and long-term solutions for optimizing the trauma room layout, and ensuring seamless workflow and 
                        accessibility to essential equipment during thoracotomy procedures. To accomplish this, we utilized skills in user research, 
                        space planning, medical equipment knowledge, and stakeholder collaboration. The goal was to prioritize patient care and 
                        medical efficiency while improving the overall functionality of the trauma room.
